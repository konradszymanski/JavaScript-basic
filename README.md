JavaScript & Bootstrap 

JavaSript basic - step back to master JacaScript basics.
I get stuck on different projects(FCC porftolio). I realised that I have many gaps I need to fill up. 
I found perfect excersises to make it happen. 

Honestly JS its very confusing & stressing for me...

but...

I dont want to give up!
